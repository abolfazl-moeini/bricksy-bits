A lightweight Bricks Builder addon that brings essential missing features ‚Äî starting with a performance-friendly `Query Loop Index` condition.

== Description ==

**Bricksy Bits** enhances Bricks Builder with tiny but essential features that are missing from the core ‚Äî built for performance and developer experience (DX).

The first feature:
- Adds a `Query Loop Index` condition to Bricks‚Äô Condition panel.
- Allows targeting items inside a loop using operators like `==`, `<`, `>`, etc.
- The index starts from `0` for better logical control.
- Great for creating custom layouts without writing multiple queries.

Stop duplicating queries just to style the first few posts differently. Now you can do it with a single loop.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/bricksy-bits` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugin screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to any Query Loop inside Bricks and use `Query Loop Index` in the conditions dropdown.
